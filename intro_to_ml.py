There are so many buzzwords around, like *artificial intelligence* (AI), *machine learning* (ML), *deep learning* (DL), *data science* (DS), etc. and many use these terms interchangeably. But each of the terms have their own meaning and although their boundaries are not clearly defined. Letâ€™s look at some of these terms with the help of the following diagram:
"""
	st.markdown(markdown)
	col1, col2 = st.columns(2)
	with col1:
		st.image(load_image("images/i01_ai_ml_dl_ds.png"),
				 caption="AI vs ML vs DL vs DS")
	with col2:
		markdown="""
- **Artificial Intelligence** (AI):
- **Machine Learning** (ML):
- **Deep Learning** (DL):
- **Data Science** (DS):
